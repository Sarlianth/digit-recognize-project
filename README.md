# Digit Recognizing Project
My name is Adrian Sypos, and I am a final year student of Software Development in GMIT.

As part of the module called [Emerging Technologies](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/), we have been asked to develop a web application in Python that will allow user to submit or draw an image containing a single digit. The application then should respond with the digit contained in the image. I will develop that project using [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras Library](https://keras.io/). Wrapped into a web app using [Flask Micro Framework](http://flask.pocoo.org/).

Complete instructions to the problem can be found [here](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/project.html). That project is worth 40% of the marks for this module.
